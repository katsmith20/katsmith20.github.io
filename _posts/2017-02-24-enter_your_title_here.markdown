**A New Set of Eyes **

HTML and CSS have presented a new set of challenges I am so excited to face. I've always wanted to have the "eye" for design. When I think about designers I picture clear framed glasses, white tee, black jeans. Maybe a piercing or tattoo? There's always something about them you can't quite put your finger that just gives them this innate "hipness." 

But the design "eye" doesn't come from being hip. It comes from understanding how the layers of HTML and CSS work together to build a product. 

After starting on the HTML and CSS section in the Flatiron curriculum, I wanted to have a more conceptual knowledge of web design. I started reading the book *Design for Hackers* by David Kadavy
