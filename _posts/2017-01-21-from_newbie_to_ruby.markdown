**How's it going?**

So far so good! I'm having so much fun learning through the Flatiron School. The platform has been a great way for me to continue working and learning to code simultaneously. During the past few weeks, I've gained a more comprehensive knowledge of code and how to use it in "real world" applications. SUPER EXCITING! 

**What am I most excited about?**

First of all, I am so happy to finally kick start a more in depth education in computer programming, it has been a long time coming. 

As we all know, programming languages are constantly evolving. There is always something new to learn, new challenges to face, and new programs to build. Every day developing is different, and who could ask for a more exciting career?!

Being able to code allows a level of creative and professional freedom. There is huge potential for growth and competition, especially within the animation industry . Software Developers have pushed animation into the future, and given artists new tools to create. However, it is obvious there is still room for improvement. I hope to be able to utilize my work experiences along with the knowledge I gain from Flatiron to keep pushing the animation industry forward.
