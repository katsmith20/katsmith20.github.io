Getting through Object Oriented Ruby has been fun. The next steps in the curriculum include SQL, Rack, ActiveRecord, Sinatra, Rails and JavaScript. 

Throughout the course, I have constantly been questioning what I can do with my newfound knowledge. How can I apply what I now know to actually *build* something? 

**What can I do?**

Ruby is a great back end languange. At this point, I can build CLI applications executable from within my terminal. Using HTML and CSS I can create the front end of my application. 

But how do I connect the front end with the back end?

Right now, it would be difficult to build an application where my Ruby programming would communicate with my HTML/ CSS programming. However, moving into SQL, Active Record, and Sinatra, I will soon be able to see my programming ideas come to life with front and back end communication.

**Looking Forward**

I have certainly enjoyed learning in depth about the power Ruby. However, I am super excited to move onto new languages such as Rails, that will make creating functional back and front end code more efficient and effective.
