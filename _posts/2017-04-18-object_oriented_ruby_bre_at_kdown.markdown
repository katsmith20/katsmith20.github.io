It's always a little bit intimidating to finish a section in the curriculum, and feel like you're starting from step one all over again when learning a new topic. While I was trying to wrap my head around what exactly object orientation is, I found it helpful to clearly define the purpose of object orientation, and why programmers rely on it so heavily. While Procedural Ruby has been so fun to learn and utilize in my coding, Object Oriented Ruby introduces a new and clearly organized way to map out and execute a program. 

**So what exactly does Object Orientation mean?**

Object Oriented Ruby is essentially what it sounds like, programming oriented around objects. It is a programming paradigm that is based on interactions between objects which fall within a hierarchy of classes. 

*But what is an object?* 

Objects, either tangible or abstract, are instances of a particular class that contain both data and methods. These objects are modeled after real-world objects. An objects' data and methods, or their attributes and actions, cooperate and interact with each other within the class and program. 

Each object has characteristic properties and behaviors. Think of it as though each object is its own identifiable *thing* that can distinguish itself from other *things.* In fact, objects are *~self aware~*. Not like a sentient being or anything, but by using `self` within a method, we can reference the calling object. 

*And a class?*

Classes in object orietned Ruby are essentially modular repositories that serve as a blueprint in which the objects live. While these classes can and do interact with one another, it is better that they be able to function as much on their own as possible.

**How does Object Oriented Ruby work?**

Object Oriented Ruby is a bottom up approach to program design. Meaning, the program is built starting with the less complex sub systems (made up of classes and objects) that link together to form a more complex system. 

So far throughout this course we have been learning a top-down design of programming. Procedural Ruby starts with a problem, and works to break it down into smaller problems. Procedural Ruby is also based on, you know....procedures. 

**Why is Object Oriented Ruby useful?**

Object Orientation is useful for many reasons. First of all, it reduces the risk of cascading development problems. With Object Orientation, individual modules (classes) may be easier maintain as they are more independent environments. 

Another major benefit of using object orientation is *reuse.* Objects and functions can be reused, reapplied, etc. This allows for much faster and concise programming! 

**Thoughts to end on...**

Object Orientation is extremely important and useful, there's no denying that. It is fast, less risky, and easier to maintain. While I am still being introduced to the concept, I am excited to learn the more complex uses for object orientations and implement it into my programming.
