When I first started learning CSS and reading *Design for Hackers*, I didn't have a full understanding of the scope that design influences the suceess of a program. This led me to do additional research on UX Design and the effect that a user's experience has on the implementation of the code. 

Reading into UX design brought me back to an episode of *Silicon Valley*, when they realize that their program had only been tested by a group of their peers. They didn't think to hire a UX designer in order to test the usability of their app for different persona. UH OH! Turns out a single group of users cannot represent how other users will interact with the design. There are a number of steps that a designer should take in order to ensure that your product is accessible to a wide/ targeted audience. 

First and foremost, it is important to fully understand the goal of company or program. With that knowledge and on a very basic level, a developper should try to put herself or himself in each user's shoes by creating individual personas and user profiles, attempt to "experience" the site as they would, and from there take steps to ammend any areas that they feel does not allow for a usable, accessible, and overall positive experience. 

While I don't want to pursue a career in User Experience Design, I am excited to think about CSS and design with a more UX mindset. Every font, spacing, color, and navigation should be thought of with usability and the goal of the product in mind.
