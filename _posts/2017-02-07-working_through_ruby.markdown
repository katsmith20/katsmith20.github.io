It has been a busy few weeks of coding! I am currently working on building my Tic Tac Toe game and have learned some really valuable lessons along the way. 

When I first started working in Learnm getting a ton error codes seemed like I was doing everything wrong. It wasn't until the lesson discussing error codes and writing your own tests that I realized I should be using these error codes to help me create more succinct and concise code. Originally, I would address the errors within my code as a whole. However, after learning that creating tests and getting errors are just a tool at each programmers disposal, I began targeting my fixes to be more precise and aligned with individual error codes.  

At the moment, I am working on getting the CLI to play through an entire game. I have run into a few hurdles so far. Right now, instead of ending the game when the tic tac toe game is over, my code loops back to the beginning. I've been working through each error message associated with that issue, and have been able to correct most of the code. It gets slightly frustrating thinking you've realized what you were doing wrong the whole time, fixing it, and getting the same error code. But the satisfaction of working through and resolving each problem is amazing. 

After this section I move onto HTML. I am really excited to keep moving through the lessons and learn how each language can interact with one another in a program.
