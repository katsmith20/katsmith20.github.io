It has been a busy few weeks of coding! I am still currently working on building my Tic Tac Toe game and have learned some really valuable lessons. 

I think the part that I have had to work through the most has been learning how to be concise when testing my code. When I first started working in Learn and getting error codes, I would address the problem with the code as a whole. However, after getting through the lessons, I realized that the error codes are just a part of the process of coding. Analyzing the code function by function has allowed me to target my fixes and execute my code in more cohesive manner. 

At the moment, I am working on getting the CLI to operate correctly and play through an entire game. The hurdles I have run into are getting the loop in my code to stop once the game is finished, instead of looping back through to the beginning of the game.
